I am an aspiring Full Satack Software Developer.
Currently I am focusing on the 2 front end technologies, Flutter and React.
The back-end frameworks that I am focusing on are Spring Framework and Spring Boot.
I have worked on both monolithic and micro-service architectures.

My goal is to master the above technologies so I can develop full stack application.
I am open to learning new technologies as needs arise.
